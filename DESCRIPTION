Description: This package is designed for individuals
               interested in the construction of Frame matrices
               either in pursuit of new Frame construction methods,
               determining if an object is a Frame, or quick Frame
               generation in applications.  The user should understand
               basic Frame Theory and definitions as well as simple
               Character Theory of Groups. An understanding of
               experimental design will also help with the Steiner
               construction functions. A sample data set (sETF) is
               provided for the user's ease of understanding. It is not
               designed as an instruction tool, but rather a suite of
               tools to aid in the pursuit of Frame Theory applications.
                 FRame.BuildR provides the user with a variety of
               functions for constructing and checking Frame
               Matrices.  The user can either construct a frame
               using known methods (Steiner, McFarland, Difference
               sets/families) or construct their own and check its
               features (e.g. Equiangular, Tight, Equichordal, etc).
               The focus of the package is to create Frame,
               Difference Set/Family, or Group objects in order
               to test new frame construction or the generation
               of a frame for a given vector space.
