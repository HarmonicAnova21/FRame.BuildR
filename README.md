# FRame.BuildR
repository for FRame.BuildR Package
================
13 March 2020
Version: 0.1
================
This is a personal package I developed for integrating Frames into my personal code.  If you are new to this, please ensure that you build the vignette when you install the package, e.g.
`devtools::install_github('HarmonicAnova21/FRame.BuildR',build_vignettes = TRUE )`
If you don't, the vignett will not be available to you.
